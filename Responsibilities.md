# Responsibilities

[build | pending]

**Responsibilities** is a simple project-management web-app for budding programmers who probably already _know how to code_, but need a little help with project organization, or maybe __just getting started__. It is built with the understanding that sometimes, great coders need to step away from the javascript and focus on who their what is for, how it will be used, and how to easily optimize the user experience by describing the day-to-day value of their idea long before they begin writing for-loops of making API calls. **Responsibilities** also helps you map out project sprints, and stay on track based on the difficulty of the task, becuase we all know how hard time-management can be sometimes, especially when starting a new and exciting project!

# Getting Started

When starting a new project, you will first be asked a couple easy questions to help **Responsibilities** set up some of the feature functionality, which you will see on the second page. It is also meant to help you begin to get into the creative/planning mindset so that you can build an outline——with our help. The outline-writing section is semi-guided with prompts, but nothing is completely mandatory. So the steps to building a project in **Responsibilities** are: 

  1) Create a new project. This includes inputting the project name, the due-date, and the names of the people involved.  
  2) You will then be directed to the Outline page, where you are expected to write as brief or as detailed an outline of your project as you see fit. ***We don't necessarily believe that more detail will equal a better project, but we do recognize that having some solid information in your outline will save you time and frustration down the line. The idea of the outline is not to discuss code or coding, but so breakdown user interaction. If you always have an eye to how your product is going to be used, the code will fall into place behind it, and it will be harder to make a wrong turn. *** We have included some prompts to help you get started and as you go. 
  3) Read over what you just wrote. Anything that stands out and something you want to see accomplished, simply highlight it and drag into the "Task Bin".
  4) Anytime that you open the "Task Page" while there are tasks in the Bin, you will need to make some decisions before you are able to progress. For each task in the bin, you will need to decide if it is necessary to the initial creation of what we call "Minimum Viable Product," or MVP. If not, it will be locked in the "bonus bin," a special area where a lot of cool ideas are going to hanging out waiting to see if you finish the initial goals early enough. 
  5) The Task Page is basically a list of tasks that need to get done in order to reach the MVP. Clicking a task may give you a task description, and it will definitely give you the opportunity to write your own or edit one that is already there.
  6) Until we have proper sign in functionality, go ahead and click your name at the top of the page so **Responsibilities** knows who you are. Your name is also associated with a color for easy identification. 
  7) When you see a task you want to take on, click the "Accept Task" button. You will be prompted to rate the projected difficulty of the task, and the task badge will change to your color. 
  8) When you have finished picking tasks for yourself, click the 'set schedule' button. This does not tell you how long a given task will take, but simply when you should be done with it if you want to stay on schedule. 
  9) You can toggle your screen to hide or display the tasks that are not assigned to you. 
10) When you finish a task, hurray ! click "task complete" on the task badge and keep moving. 



## Stretch Goals 

- take a look at the bottom of the page. not only is the due date ever-present, but there are two progress bars that are (hopefully!) constantly moving right, slowing filling up as you go. The green bar is the overall progress on the task it self, determined by the total number of tasks and degree of difficulty. The red bar below is simply the passage of time since you started the task. Your goal is to keep the green bar ahead of the red bar.  
- user id + password ? 

### Tech

For this project we will be using: 

* [Bootstrap](<https://getbootstrap.com/>) - let someone else build the buttons amirite
* [Express](<http://expressjs.com>) - we can talk to node and mongoose can talk to mongoDB, but node and mongoose only talk to express. or something ?
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - less typing, more, uhhh, cool functions and stuff. oh and ajax
* [Mongoose](<https://mongoosejs.com/>) - cool way to make mongoDB more people-friendly and add easier relationality
* [Node](<http://nodejs.org>) - basically javascript but there somethig else about it
