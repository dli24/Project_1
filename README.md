# Responsibilities App

[build | pending]

**Responsibilities** is a simple project-management web-app for budding programmers who probably already _know how to code_, but need a little help with project organization, or maybe __just getting started__. It is built with the understanding that sometimes, great coders need to step away from the javascript and focus on who their what is for, how it will be used, and how to easily optimize the user experience by describing the day-to-day value of their idea long before they begin writing for-loops of making API calls. **Responsibilities** also helps you map out project sprints, and stay on track based on the difficulty of the task, becuase we all know how hard time-management can be sometimes, especially when starting a new and exciting project!

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - less typing, more, uhhh, cool functions and stuff. oh and ajax
* [Mongoose](<https://mongoosejs.com/>) - cool way to make mongoDB more people-friendly and add easier relationality
